Through interactive storytelling, minimalist design, and archival research, Ruh preserves disappearing rituals while inviting viewers to reflect on their own sensory memories. This project asks: how do we archive something as intangible as scent? Ruh offers a gentle, immersive response, where heritage is not only remembered, but felt through design.",

The urban landscape, thought to exclude nature, hosts it. \nEven in environments dominated by concrete and smog, nature bares its face.\nThis collection highlights fauna quietly enduring beneath the architecture of progress.\nBy observing the animals that persist despite anthropogenic climate change, we can close the gap.\nUnder streetlights and between cracks in concrete, life teems, silent witnesses to our coexistence.\nTowers build not away from nature, but grow alongside it.",

Caught between innocence and transformation, the mixed media animation mirrors the inner struggles and cyclical nature of healing. Subtly inspired by the myth of Persephone, it explores descent and return through tarot-inspired cards that guide a symbolic journey through identity and womanhood.",
