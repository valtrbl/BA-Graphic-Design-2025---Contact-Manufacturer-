Both publications are packaged together within the �adorable overload collection� in which I printed a run of 24 of each publication, each photo book featuring a different cover.",

In this unfolding, they become both increasingly visible and fluid, thresholds merging into one another. Bound by the usual perimeters of which we encounter in our daily life, it is not often that these intersections are adjoined. There is importance in more closely noticing these divisions, where one thing ends and another begins.",
