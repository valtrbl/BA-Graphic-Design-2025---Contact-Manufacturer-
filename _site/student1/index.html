    <p class="student-caption">In a world of movement and migration, the definition of home has become rather personal and layered. For some people, home may be a physical place, for others, it’s a memory, a person, a scent or even food. Is home considered a simple location, or is it more than this? Does it move with us and live within small parts of our daily lives?

&quot;There&#39;s Food At Home&#39; is an embroidered tablecloth &amp; publication exploring the connection between home, migration and how food can evoke memories of this. The tablecloth symbolising a space of community, sharing and care for each other and the bringing together of different experiences.</p>

Materials bear the marks of time, contact, the conditions of the environments they inhabit, and the marks they obtain can carry the knowledge of those encounters. This publication looks at wear as an addition, not subtraction of value – a new presence in the absence of what was before.

    <p class="student-caption">This publication is a collection of images taken from Google Street View of houses with special sentimental meaning to me throughout my hometown of Halesowen in Dudley. It acts as a reflection on my change of perspective of the West Midlands after three years living in London. I miss the accent, I miss the warmth of the people, I miss the battered chips (getting hungry just thinking about them...), and I miss my family.     

The book is made up of 11 sheets of A3 folded down to A5; when unfolded, they become double-sided posters (three-in-one).

    <h2 class="project-title">Dream Job</h2>
    <p class="student-caption">This project explores how to bring more fun into work life by questioning the normalised pessimism around adulthood and jobs. By transforming ordinary office items into nostalgic, surreal objects, it asks what a dream job might look like.

Optimism is hard to maintain, especially when adult goals like buying a house or finding fulfilling work feel unattainable. Our generation often tries to heal its inner child through consumerism, but this project explores how true healing can come from relearning how to play. The space uses colourful 2000s styles like Frutiger Aero and mediums ranging from riso printing to papier-mâché and ceramics.</p>

Advancements in technology has led to humans being flooded with images on a daily basis, which has caused fragmented focus and repetitive behaviors. The project uses slower processes of making, like risography and screen printing, to highlight these repetitive behaviors and demonstrate how they can result in us taking in images more consciously and carefully in order to understand the world around us.</p>

Inspired by the lost craft of lace-making and the discontinued Letra-set, this project blends delicate history with modern design. The square letterforms are inspired by lace patterns, forming a pixel-based visual language.
In an age of boredom filled with screen time, Pixel Pack offers a tactile, entry-level design tool. Mimicking the Letra-set, it invites a slower, more playful way of making.

As a Pakistani, mixed-race woman I have often felt separated from my homeland. I have never had the opportunity to visit Pakistan, and when being born and raised in England it can be hard to feel connected to my heritage. 

This project is an exploration of my ancestry and identity through traditional printing techniques and cultural archiving of family photos. The publication can be read either right-to-left to tell the story from my grandmother&#39;s perspective, or left-to-right to tell the story from my own perspective.</p>

    <p class="student-caption">Everybody Moves is a movement that reframes body image in fitness, encouraging people of all shapes, sizes, and experience levels to embrace movement. It uses animals as playful, inclusive metaphors to show that all forms of activity are valid. A system of custom modular shapes creates various animals, inviting personal and imaginative connections. This is paired with a bold, chunky typeface that complements the geometric forms, building a cohesive and welcoming visual language. The campaign challenges unrealistic fitness standards and celebrates movement as something everyone can enjoy in their own way.</p>

Home Letter Map is an interactive visual novel about memory, migration, and cultural identity. Inspired by Taishan’s overseas Chinese heritage, it guides players through meaningful hometown sites—train stations, courtyards, food stalls—blending storytelling and reflection. Aimed at second-generation migrants and young workers away from home, the game reimagines family letters as a digital experience, inviting players to reconnect with their roots and explore what “home” truly means.</p>

    <h2 class="project-title">Unfolding Boundaries</h2>
    <p class="student-caption">This book unfolds not as single images but as a series of edges and intersections. Each image is a cross section, a point at which boundaries both merge and divide. We navigate junctions everyday - geographical, political, emotional - some visible, some left unseen. In this unfolding, they become both increasingly visible and fluid, thresholds merging into one another. Bound by the usual perimeters of which we encounter in our daily life, it is not often that these intersections are adjoined. There is importance in more closely noticing these divisions, where one thing ends and another begins.</p>

Each knot is both a topological object and a three-dimensional structure, revealing how repetition and modularity can drive generative variation. The knot projections are printed using a thermal receipt printer, emphasising the relationship between systematic repetition and the ephemeral nature of the material output.</p>

As we teach AI to sort, generate, and organize visual media, its output teaches us to recognize unfamiliar, sometimes uncanny, patterns of visual association. We begin to subconsciously understand the intricacies of AI logic; the strange cohesion of images grouped not by subject, but by texture, lighting, compression artifacts, or other non-human priorities.</p>

Patrycja Eastwood emigrated to the UK from Poland in 1994 as a young adult. Despite her love of writing, she felt trapped between two languages.

    <p class="student-caption">An experience in a diverse city inspired this project as I realised how normalised microaggression is. I found that it is also a discussion often brought in professional settings, schools or work and is often not addressed in public settings. My ceramics tell the story of anonymously submitted experienced, the design mimics the experience by being concealed on the inside of the ceramics so the viewer is forced to interact with it when they eat or drink from it. This project aims to start dialogue to make people more aware of everyday microaggressions that once noticed can be challenged.</p>

    <p class="student-caption">This project explores the playful power of DIY instrument culture to make music-making more accessible and judgment-free. By crafting unconventional tools for rhythm and sound, Birth the Groove lowers the stakes of grooving in public—inviting everyone to move, play, and participate without fear. It’s not about being good; it’s about being in it.</p>

    <p class="student-caption">Ruh: The Ritual Archive of South Asian Scent is a digital exploration of the sacred, cultural, and emotional role of scent across South Asia. Inspired by oral traditions and ancestral rituals, the project reimagines how smell can be documented in a digital space. Through interactive storytelling, minimalist design, and archival research, Ruh preserves disappearing rituals while inviting viewers to reflect on their own sensory memories. This project asks: how do we archive something as intangible as scent? Ruh offers a gentle, immersive response, where heritage is not only remembered, but felt through design.</p>

    <h2 class="project-title">Bridging the Metabolic Rift</h2>
    <p class="student-caption">This project explores the intersection of ecology and urban infrastructure, interrogating the perceived division between the natural world and the built environment. The urban landscape, thought to exclude nature, hosts it. 
Even in environments dominated by concrete and smog, nature bares its face.
This collection highlights fauna quietly enduring beneath the architecture of progress.
By observing the animals that persist despite anthropogenic climate change, we can close the gap.
Under streetlights and between cracks in concrete, life teems, silent witnesses to our coexistence.
Towers build not away from nature, but grow alongside it.</p>

    <p class="student-caption">The visualizer for indie pop artist Matilda Cole’s “Rib Cage”, from her EP Pomegranate, translates the song’s raw reflection on girlhood, legacy, and emotional inheritance into a dreamlike visual loop. Caught between innocence and transformation, the mixed media animation mirrors the inner struggles and cyclical nature of healing. Subtly inspired by the myth of Persephone, it explores descent and return through tarot-inspired cards that guide a symbolic journey through identity and womanhood.</p>

    <p class="student-caption">This project explores the relationship between football clubs and pubs, specifically the home pubs. For fans, there’s no better feeling than walking into a pub that’s drenched in their team’s memorabilia, surrounded by fans creating feeling of community and belonging. One thing brings these people together: the love for their team. 
 
Focusing on 12 London teams, ranging from the Premier League to League Two, this project celebrates the places fans can find sanctuary before and after the game. Displaying beer mats, bottles and a scrapbook to create the familiar environment of a pub, here’s to these pubs and their clubs.</p>

    <p class="student-caption">RE-WIRED is an A – Z glossary of terms and interviews about the neurodivergent experience, made by and for neurodivergent people. We aim to amplify voices of young neurodivergent adults, this demographic often lacks representation and awareness. To create the visuals for the publication, we facilitated typography workshops with neurodivergents, asking them to design letters that reflected neurodivergent aspects of their neurodivergence. Alongside the visual content, this publication shares authentic narratives from various neurodivergent individuals about their journeys, providing support and insight to newly diagnosed neurodivergent people.</p>
